#Image Classification with Transfer Learning  



## Instructions  

### 1. Dataset Research  
- Research on the internet and identify a **large image classification dataset**.  
- The dataset should contain a significant number of images (preferably in the range of tens of thousands or more).  
- Provide a brief description of the dataset in your report, including:  
  - **Dataset name**  
  - **Number of classes**  
  - **Total number of images**  
  - **Source** (e.g., website, research paper, etc.)  

### 2. Model Selection  
- Select any **pre-trained model** available for transfer learning. Examples include:  
  - ResNet  
  - Inception  
  - MobileNet  
  - VGG  
  - EfficientNet  
- Justify your choice of model in your report (e.g., explain why you think it is suitable for your selected dataset).  

### 3. Implementation  
- **Preprocess** the dataset (e.g., resizing, normalization, augmentation).  
- **Fine-tune** your selected pre-trained model on the dataset.  
- Train the model for a suitable number of epochs and track the training and validation performance (e.g., accuracy and loss).  

### 4. Evaluation  
- Evaluate your model on a test set and report the performance metrics.  
- Include visualizations in your submission, such as:  
  - Training curves (accuracy and loss over epochs).  
  - Confusion matrix.  

### 5. Report  
Write a detailed report summarizing the following:  
- The **dataset** you selected and its key characteristics.  
- The **pre-trained model** you used and why you selected it.  
- **Preprocessing steps** and training procedure.  
- **Results** (include accuracy, loss, and visualizations).
